# Commit syntax

Each commit should follow the Conventional Commits convention:

    <type>(<optional scope>): <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer]

# Commit types used

    - chore: small maintenance tasks that don't affect application behaviour
        e.g. chore(vc): add empty file to document commit conventions

    - ci: changes related to CI configuration files and scripts
        e.g. ci(vc): update with mypy pre-commit hook

    - docs: documentation
        e.g. docs(vc): update commit conventions.

    - exp: an experiment committed only for learning/checking purposes.
        e.g. exp(vc): test mypy hook with `int + str` expression

    - feat:
        e.g. feat(data): add initial dataset files
        e.g. feat(constants): add paths for dataset files

# Commit scopes used
    - `vc`: doing something with version control
    - `setup`: doing something to setup the repo
    - `data`: doing something with raw data
    - `constants`: doing something with constants
